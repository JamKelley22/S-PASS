## What this is...?
Over the Summer and Fall of 2017 the three of us (Masashi Schafer, Natalie Blodgett, & Jameel Kelley) were accepted into the Iowa State SPIRE HCI REU Program. We were then assigned to the CooL:SLiCE project as our main research focus. The main goal of this research is to improve the usability of the S-PASS tool and integrate it into the web.

## How do we plan to improve S-PASS usability...?
To increase the usability of the S-PASS tool we plan to...
1. Preform an initial usability study on the current S-PASS tool
2. Gather and analyze the data so we can address and incorporate critical features into the new, web portal.
3. Perform the same usability study, but with the new tool
4. Write a paper about it

## Ok but why is this important...?
We are creating a new learning tool for Engineering students to improve the quality of their education! We have found that education usually does not focus on the sustainability aspect of design. It is vitally important that students today are conscientious of the world they live in and its needs. Thus we must begin learning the skills of how to design sustainably. We hope the S-PASS Web tool can be our contribution to that effort.
